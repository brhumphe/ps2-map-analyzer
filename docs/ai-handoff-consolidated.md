## Project Overview

### Purpose & Domain

**Application**: Real-time PlanetSide 2 Territory Analyzer - tactical visualization tool for the PlanetSide 2 massively multiplayer online game.

**Core Value Proposition**: Helps players make strategic decisions by visualizing lattice connections, territory ownership, and tactical opportunities on interactive maps. Fills gap in existing PS2 community tools by focusing on predictive/strategic analysis rather than historical statistics.

**Portfolio Context**: Project demonstrates refactoring skills by migrating from procedural TypeScript to reactive Vue architecture. Differentiates from typical CRUD applications through interactive data visualization, real-time strategic analysis, and complex state management across multiple data sources.

### Domain Context

For complete PlanetSide 2 game mechanics, facility types, and strategic concepts, see `docs/domain-knowledge.md`.

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Composition API + TypeScript + Vuetify + Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Optional Python/FastAPI (available for experimentation)
- **Data Sources**: Census, Sanctuary, Honu
- **Mapping**: Custom coordinate system conversion (PS2 world coordinates â†” Leaflet coordinates)

## Architectural Foundations

### Core Design Philosophy

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data analysis, styling, and rendering
2. **Provider Pattern Flexibility**: Swappable implementations for analysis and styling modes
3. **Reactive Pipeline**: Vue reactivity drives updates through entire visualization chain
4. **Performance-Conscious**: Client-side analysis for immediate responsiveness
5. **Interface-Based Design**: Define contracts before implementations
6. **Frontend-First**: Originally conceived as backend-focused, development revealed that frontend-only processing provides better user experience

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

#### 1. Frontend-First Architecture Evolution

- **Original Design**: Backend-focused due to user's professional experience
- **Discovery**: Client-side processing better serves use case (O(n) on ~89 nodes vs 50-200ms network latency)
- **Current State**: Territory analysis happens client-side for immediate responsiveness
- **Backend Status**: Available for experimentation and architectural flexibility

#### 2. Incremental Vue Migration Strategy

- **Decision**: Wrap existing TypeScript logic in Vue's composition API, then gradually extract
- **Reasoning**: Preserve complex working code (coordinate conversion, hexagon geometry)
- **Evolution**: Started with import maps and inline components â†’ proper build system â†’ headless components
- **Status**: Successfully migrated basic map functionality to Vue

#### 3. Headless Component Architecture

- **Decision**: Individual Vue components manage single Leaflet objects (`PolylineEntity`, `PolygonEntity`, `MarkerEntity`)
- **Reasoning**: Separate Leaflet lifecycle from business logic, enable granular updates
- **Status**: Implemented and working for lattice links, region polygons, and facility markers

#### 4. Client-Side Analysis Default

- **Decision**: Territory analysis happens in browser by default, with optional backend processing
- **Reasoning**: Network latency (50-200ms) dominates computation time for 89-node graphs
- **Status**: Architecture established, analysis providers partially implemented

#### 5. Provider Pattern for Flexibility

- **Decision**: Interface-based providers for analysis and styling to enable multiple visualization modes
- **Reasoning**: Support different tactical analysis approaches, easy testing, portfolio demonstration
- **Status**: Established and working with complete analysis provider implementations

#### 6. Composable-Based State Management

- **Decision**: Centralized state management through specialized composables (`useAppState`, `useMapDisplaySettings`, etc.)
- **Reasoning**: Provides reactive state sharing across components while maintaining clear separation of concerns
- **Status**: Fully implemented with composables for app state, display settings, territory data, and map entities

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Third-party PS2 API â†’ Territory Data Service â†’ Analysis Provider â†’ Style Provider â†’ Vue Components â†’ Leaflet Objects
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Major Problems Solved

1. **Template Reactivity with Maps**: Vue templates can't iterate `readonly(reactive(Map))` - solution is to skip readonly wrapper
2. **Coordinate System Conversion**: PS2 uses Y-up 3D, Leaflet uses 2D - implemented transformation utilities
3. **Z-ordering Issues**: Used Leaflet panes system for predictable layer ordering
4. **Performance with Bulk Updates**: Individual reactive objects perform better than large nested structures
5. **Leaflet Lifecycle Management**: Headless components bridge Vue reactivity with Leaflet object lifecycle
6. **Map Container Reinitialization**: Leaflet throws "container already initialized" errors - solved with complete cleanup/recreate pattern
7. **Component Architecture Complexity**: Large monolithic MapApp component - solved by separating concerns into MapApp (UI) + MapComponent (map logic)
8. **CORS with External Tiles**: Browser blocks cross-origin tile requests - resolved by accepting console warnings (tiles still load correctly)
9. **Leaflet Label Implementation**: Created always-visible facility labels using MarkerEntity with permanent tooltips and invisible markers
10. **TypeScript Strict Mode Migration**: Successfully enabled `noImplicitAny` across entire codebase without breaking functionality
11. **Data Structure Performance**: Migrated from array-based to Map-based zone data for O(1) region/link lookups and future graph analysis
12. **Facility Label Visibility**: Implemented always-visible facility names using MarkerEntity with permanent tooltips
13. **Leaflet Pane Switching**: Leaflet doesn't automatically move objects between panes when options change - solved with remove/re-add pattern for dynamic state transitions
14. **Real-time Continent Status**: Integrated Honu API for live continent lock/unlock status with proper error handling and loading states

### Critical Implementation Notes

- **Coordinate Conversion**: ALL spatial data must go through `world_to_latLng()` utilities
- **Component Dependencies**: Headless components require valid props (map instance, sufficient points)
- **Provider Interfaces**: Analysis needs both territory data AND zone data to function
- **Leaflet Pane Management**: Objects don't automatically move between panes when `options.pane` changes - must remove and re-add objects for pane transitions

## Development Practices Established

### Code Organization

- **Layered directory structure** by responsibility (composables/map/, composables/territory/, services/, etc.)
- **Interface-first design** for all provider patterns
- **Composables for coordination**, services for business logic
- **Individual components** per map object for granular updates

### Testing Strategy

- **Pure function extraction** for easily testable business logic
- **Provider pattern testing** with mock implementations
- **Dependency injection** for external libraries (Leaflet)

### Technical Evolution

- **Build System Decision**: Initially avoided complex build tools (Vite/webpack) to focus on Vue concepts, using import maps and inline components. Later evolved to proper build system as comfort with reactive patterns increased
- **Component Evolution**: Started with inline components in single files, progressed to headless component architecture, then to proper Vue component architecture with provider patterns
- **Migration Strategy**: Incremental approach from procedural to reactive, preserving complex working code while introducing Vue benefits step-by-step

### Debugging Approaches

- **Coordinate system debugging** with mouse coordinate popup
- **Component lifecycle tracking** with console logging
- **Territory data structure inspection** with reactive watchers
- **Provider swap testing** for isolation of issues
- **Debug panel integration** with developer-specific diagnostic tools
