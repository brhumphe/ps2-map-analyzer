## Project Overview

### Purpose & Domain
**Application**: Real-time PlanetSide 2 Territory Analyzer - tactical visualization tool for the PlanetSide 2 massively multiplayer online game.

**Core Value Proposition**: Helps players make strategic decisions by visualizing lattice connections, territory ownership, and tactical opportunities on interactive maps. Fills gap in existing PS2 community tools by focusing on predictive/strategic analysis rather than historical statistics.

**Portfolio Context**: Project demonstrates refactoring skills by migrating from procedural TypeScript to reactive Vue architecture. Differentiates from typical CRUD applications through interactive data visualization, real-time strategic analysis, and complex state management across multiple data sources.

### Domain Context (Critical for AI Understanding)
- **PlanetSide 2**: Large-scale online warfare game with territorial control mechanics
- **Continents**: 4 large map areas (Indar, Amerish, Esamir, Hossin) with ~89 regions each
- **Factions**: 4 competing teams (VS=1, NC=2, TR=3, NSO=4) fighting for territorial control
- **Lattice Links**: Strategic connections between facilities (~129 links per continent)
- **Territory Control**: Real-time ownership that changes during gameplay (2-3 changes per minute)
- **Tactical Significance**: "Contestable" links (connecting enemy facilities) represent tactical opportunities

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Composition API + TypeScript + Vuetify + Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Optional Python/FastAPI (available for experimentation)
- **Data Sources**: Third-party PS2 Census API for real-time territory data
- **Mapping**: Custom coordinate system conversion (PS2 world coordinates ↔ Leaflet coordinates)

## Architectural Foundations

### Core Design Philosophy
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data analysis, styling, and rendering
2. **Provider Pattern Flexibility**: Swappable implementations for analysis and styling modes
3. **Reactive Pipeline**: Vue reactivity drives updates through entire visualization chain
4. **Performance-Conscious**: Client-side analysis for immediate responsiveness
5. **Interface-Based Design**: Define contracts before implementations
6. **Frontend-First**: Originally conceived as backend-focused, development revealed that frontend-only processing provides better user experience

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

#### 1. Frontend-First Architecture Evolution
- **Original Design**: Backend-focused due to user's professional experience
- **Discovery**: Client-side processing better serves use case (O(n) on ~89 nodes vs 50-200ms network latency)
- **Current State**: Territory analysis happens client-side for immediate responsiveness
- **Backend Status**: Available for experimentation and architectural flexibility

#### 2. Incremental Vue Migration Strategy
- **Decision**: Wrap existing TypeScript logic in Vue's composition API, then gradually extract
- **Reasoning**: Preserve complex working code (coordinate conversion, hexagon geometry)
- **Evolution**: Started with import maps and inline components → proper build system → headless components
- **Status**: Successfully migrated basic map functionality to Vue

#### 3. Headless Component Architecture
- **Decision**: Individual Vue components manage single Leaflet objects (`PolylineEntity`, `PolygonEntity`)
- **Reasoning**: Separate Leaflet lifecycle from business logic, enable granular updates
- **Status**: Implemented and working for lattice links and region polygons

#### 4. Client-Side Analysis Default
- **Decision**: Territory analysis happens in browser by default, with optional backend processing
- **Reasoning**: Network latency (50-200ms) dominates computation time for 89-node graphs
- **Status**: Architecture established, analysis providers partially implemented

#### 5. Provider Pattern for Flexibility
- **Decision**: Interface-based providers for analysis and styling to enable multiple visualization modes
- **Reasoning**: Support different tactical analysis approaches, easy testing, portfolio demonstration
- **Status**: Interfaces defined, some implementations started

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Third-party PS2 API → Territory Data Service → Analysis Provider → Style Provider → Vue Components → Leaflet Objects
```

- **Style Calculation Layers**: Separate styling systems for regions and links
- **Reactive Integration**: Automatic updates when territory data changes
- **Timing Issue Resolution**: Fixed initialization order and style application timing
- **World/Continent Selection**: Fully functional dropdown menus with reactive integration
- **Component Architecture Refactoring**: Separated MapApp.vue (UI chrome) from MapComponent.vue (map lifecycle)
- **Map Lifecycle Management**: Resolved Leaflet container reinitialization errors with destroy/recreate pattern
- **External Tile Integration**: Working integration with Honu tile server (CORS warnings resolved/ignored)
- **Reactive Prop Flow**: Clean props-down data flow for world/continent changes
- **Zone Watcher Pattern**: Centralized content rebuilding triggered by currentZone changes

### 🎯 Next Steps Available
1. **Display Live state from game** - Periodic territory data updates from live API
2. **Base name labels** - Show names of bases on the map, controllable by state (only frontline bases etc.)
3. **Additional Analysis Modes** - Front-line detection, strategic value scoring
4. **UI Polish** - Remove debug logs, add legend, territory statistics display
5. **Performance Optimization** - Caching, selective updates, analysis throttling
6. **Dev mode data** - Add sample state for each continent for development
7. **Improved map loading responsiveness** - Load and display regions with default style faster during continent switch
8. **Display Mode Controls** - Toggle between analysis modes (contestable links, faction control, etc.)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Major Problems Solved
1. **Template Reactivity with Maps**: Vue templates can't iterate `readonly(reactive(Map))` - solution is to skip readonly wrapper
2. **Coordinate System Conversion**: PS2 uses Y-up 3D, Leaflet uses 2D - implemented transformation utilities
3. **Z-ordering Issues**: Used Leaflet panes system for predictable layer ordering
4. **Performance with Bulk Updates**: Individual reactive objects perform better than large nested structures
5. **Leaflet Lifecycle Management**: Headless components bridge Vue reactivity with Leaflet object lifecycle
6. **Map Container Reinitialization**: Leaflet throws "container already initialized" errors - solved with complete cleanup/recreate pattern
7. **Component Architecture Complexity**: Large monolithic MapApp component - solved by separating concerns into MapApp (UI) + MapComponent (map logic)
8. **CORS with External Tiles**: Browser blocks cross-origin tile requests - resolved by accepting console warnings (tiles still load correctly)

### Critical Implementation Notes
- **Coordinate Conversion**: ALL spatial data must go through `world_to_latLng()` utilities
- **Territory Data**: Null values indicate contested regions, not missing data
- **Component Dependencies**: Headless components require valid props (map instance, sufficient points)
- **Provider Interfaces**: Analysis needs both territory data AND zone data to function

## Development Practices Established

### Code Organization
- **Layered directory structure** by responsibility (composables/map/, composables/territory/, services/, etc.)
- **Interface-first design** for all provider patterns
- **Composables for coordination**, services for business logic
- **Individual components** per map object for granular updates

### Testing Strategy
- **Pure function extraction** for easily testable business logic
- **Provider pattern testing** with mock implementations
- **Dependency injection** for external libraries (Leaflet)

### Technical Evolution
- **Build System Decision**: Initially avoided complex build tools (Vite/webpack) to focus on Vue concepts, using import maps and inline components. Later evolved to proper build system as comfort with reactive patterns increased
- **Component Evolution**: Started with inline components in single files, progressed to headless component architecture, then to proper Vue component architecture with provider patterns
- **Migration Strategy**: Incremental approach from procedural to reactive, preserving complex working code while introducing Vue benefits step-by-step

### Debugging Approaches
- **Coordinate system debugging** with mouse coordinate popup
- **Component lifecycle tracking** with console logging
- **Territory data structure inspection** with reactive watchers
- **Provider swap testing** for isolation of issues
